3. Best Practices for Submitting Apps to App Stores

(A) For Both Platforms:
Ensure your app is fully tested (especially on real devices).

Follow store guidelines (Apple's HIG and Google’s Material Guidelines).

Provide clear app metadata (screenshots, descriptions, etc.).

Include a Privacy Policy if your app collects user data.

Use versioning and changelogs properly.

Handle permissions carefully (ask only what’s needed).

Optimize performance and size.

Localize your app if targeting multiple regions.

(B) Specific to Android:
Use Android App Bundles (AAB) for smaller install sizes.

Support multiple screen sizes and densities.

Add a feature graphic for better Play Store visibility.

(C) Specific to iOS:
Test using TestFlight before submission.

Adhere strictly to Apple’s guidelines to avoid rejection.

Provide accurate App Store privacy details.
